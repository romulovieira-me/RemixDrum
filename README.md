# RemixDrum ðŸª„ðŸŽµ

ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Este trabalho apresenta o protÃ³tipo do RemixDrum, uma ferramenta criada seguindo o paradigma do design autobiogrÃ¡fico, capaz de combinar sensores, placas microcontroladoras, conexÃ£o sem fio e aplicativos personalizados desenvolvidos nas linguagens Pure Data e Processing para remixar trilhas musicais e artes visuais em tempo real. O objetivo final Ã© aguÃ§ar o pensamento criativo dos participantes, estimulando a idealizaÃ§Ã£o de obras que exploram o hibridismo multimÃ­dia.

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸/ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ The remix technique has been widely used in musical practice, mainly due to the figure of Disc Jockeys (DJs), which combines several pre-existing sounds to produce completely new content.
However, this creation method also appears in other forms of artistic expression, such as architecture, photography, fashion design, video games, etc.
Recent technological advances favor the emergence of gadgets that help expand this practice, such as Smart Musical Instruments (SMI), devices equipped with sensors, actuators, embedded intelligence, and wireless connectivity to allow new forms of musical expression.
In view of this scenario and the versatility of remix, this paper presents a prototype of an SMI, called RemixDrum, conceived not only for creating sounds through technological means but also to allow the mixing of multimedia content, proposing a new context of use for this type of interface and a new way to make art.
Finally, the prototype was evaluated quantitatively, measuring average latency, jitter, and throughput, qualitatively, investigating the user experience and  their interaction with the equipment, and comparatively, through an analysis between our prototype and related works, in order to analyze perceptible delays, expressiveness and other artistic factors.
